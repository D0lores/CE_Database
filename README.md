# The Phrozen Keep Code Editing database

This repository is an attempt to centralize code editing knowledge of Diablo 2.
The main objective is to be able to share things such as DLL ordinals names and structures more easily.

Right now type names might not be standardized, hence why they are not included in the repository.
Any help to clean duplicates / incorrect / inconsistent names is welcome.

## Directory structures

Since the ordinal list changes from version to version, we have one folder for each one.
There is also an additional `scripts` folder to place import / export scripts for your favorite tool.
The `misc` folder can be used for DLLs that are not linked to a specific version of the game or not used by the game.

## Notes

This is an early export of some private databases, and is expected to have naming issues.
Feel free to report / fix those.
